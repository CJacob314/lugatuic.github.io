* New Website Goals

- Link images instead of embed for fastest possible load time.
- **Absolutely no JavaScript**


* Contributing Guide

- Write articles as *org* files. [Supported in VScode (citation needed)]
- Refer existing pages as a template.
- One topic per heading.
- Prioritize searchability and referencing over long explanations.
- New Website is automatically built and deployed from the ~main~ branch.

* FAQ

** 1. Why Emacs to build a website? Isn't it just a text editor?

Emacs ~org-mode~ is everything from a time-tracking tasklist to a literate programming environment like Jupyter. It comes with a publishing feature. Learn more about the power of Emacs and org-mode in your own time :D.

** 2. What if I want to write in markdown?

Use =pandoc= to convert, then add the relevant header material like `#+TITLE:` etc. You are missing out though.

** 3. Do I have to use Emacs?

No, but you should.

** B-b-but I HATE emacs I use vimerino which is CLEARLY better!!!!

Cope.
